### Edit tasks
After adding a task, users can edit any task at any time by clicking on the pencil icon next to it. As shown here, clicking the icon opens a dialog where you can change the task name directly. This allows you to refine or rename tasks as needed.

Next, the planned minutes can be adjusted. This is helpful if users over- or underestimated the time needed for a task.
